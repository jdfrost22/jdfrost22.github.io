                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>
                    I have a passion for learing and for working together on a team. I collaborate well 
                    with others and am always looking for ways to improve my skills. Although Coding is 
                    new to me, I have lots of experience leading projects and coordinating many moving parts. 
                    I am a director and producer of theatrical productions and have honed my problem solving 
                    skills through that work.
